# Crime Records Management System

## Description and Moviation:
- This project is a simple CRUD command line project that allows the user to create new records, view all the reports, view the reports by date and report number, 
 as well as updating and deleting records by title.
- I got the motivation to do this project by meeting with a company called ADSi. After a week of job shadowing the team and how they develop their 
software, I felt like I could do this as my Java project. 

## Pior Art:
- I really obtain the information that is presented through the project during my week of Job shadowing with ADSi.

## User Workplace:

- The user will be welcomed by the program and given 7 options to start off with. 
- If the user tries to view, update, or delete records that are not in the system, the user will be met with a messange, saying they have no records.
- The user will have the ability to create mutiple report, view them all, view them seperately by date and report number, as well as update a single file selected by title,
and delete by title of the report.
- The user is able to quit the program after they are back at the welcome section.

## Day to Day Goals:

- Tuesday: have a functional program that will allow the user to accomplish their task while using the program.
- Wednesday: Fixing any errors that the user stumble across.
- Thursday: making the program more presentable to the user.
- Friday: Present final product.

## How will I use the content that was covered in this Unit.

- The program will store all the user's information in an ArrayList, so it will be able to be modified in case a update is required or the report is complete or dropped.
- Scanners are used to capture the user's input for the title, date, report number, victim's name, is there a suspect or not, if there is a suspect, the name of the suspect, if the suspect has any warrant, and a description of the report.
- Included an object that held a constructor and a few functions for updating.
- for loops to go through the list and grab the information that is attached to the date or report number that the user gives.
- while loops to bring the user back to the welcome screen once they complete a option or put in an invalid selection.
- if statments for the options that the user select and how each option varies in storing or gather information.
